If progress has stalled or the process has halted, please do the following:

Please refer to docs/CRAFT_PROMPT.md for the established design guidelines and ensure that all changes adhere to these standards.

Summarize Current Progress:
 - Provide a brief summary of the steps taken and the current state of the analysis or debugging process.

Diagnose the Stall:
 - Analyze and describe any potential reasons or conditions that may be causing the stall.
Identify any repetitive patterns or blockers preventing further progress.

Propose Alternative Strategies:
- Outline at least two alternative approaches or debugging methods that have not been attempted yet.
Explain the rationale behind each proposed strategy.

Select and Implement a New Strategy:
 - Choose one of the alternative strategies, justify your choice, and document this decision in the change log.
 - Resume the debugging or testing process using the selected approach, ensuring you do not repeat the previous ineffective steps.

Resume and Continue:
 - Continue with the process, ensuring that progress is made toward resolving the issue.

By following these steps, ensure that the process remains dynamic and avoids an endless loop of repetitive attempts.
