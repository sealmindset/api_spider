Updated Project Definition & Scope

Audience & Focus:

Primary Audience: Personal use.
Threat Focus: API-specific threats (for example, API misconfigurations and insecure endpoints). Clarification: Should the prompt list specific API threats or frameworks for threat modeling (for instance, focusing on rate limiting issues or injection flaws in API parameters)?
Use Cases & Goals:

Initial Scan: Perform a blind spider of the target URL. Clarification: Will the blind spider include heuristics to detect hidden endpoints or simply collect all reachable URLs? Would you like to add a phase that performs preliminary filtering of results before a deeper scan?
Architecture and Microservices

Service Interactions & Security:

Communication Security: No mTLS or other encryption for inter-service communication.
Versioning: There is a requirement to consider API versioning and backward compatibility. Clarification: Which versioning strategy is preferred (for example, URI versioning like /v1/ or header-based versioning)? Would you like to document a specific approach in the prompt?
Service Boundaries & Error Handling:

Fallback Mechanism: Use a retry-then-fail strategy for error propagation between services. Clarification: Should the prompt specify retry counts or timeout durations, or leave these as configurable parameters?
Technology Stack & Service Definitions

Technology Shift:

Platform: Changing the implementation from Node.js/Express.js to 100% Python. Clarification: Which Python framework(s) do you plan to use? For example, Flask, FastAPI, or another framework oriented to microservices? This detail can help tailor the architecture regarding middleware, asynchronous handling, and other components.
AI Service:

Integration: Use both Ollama and OpenAI, with manual intervention as the fallback mechanism.
Analysis Focus: Validate identified vulnerabilities through anomaly detection and adapt to create the necessary scanner to test a vulnerability. Clarification: Would you like to define the criteria or workflow that triggers manual intervention? For instance, should there be an alert or decision panel when the primary AI engine fails?
Scan Service:

Scope: Focus on API-centric security checks using Python-compatible modules. Clarification: Can you list a few example checks or libraries you expect to incorporate? This would provide more concrete guidance for development.
Validation & Report Services:

Risk Quantification: Based on factors such as ease of exploitation and real-world examples.
Reporting: Designed to be modular, allowing users to pick and choose parts of the report. Clarifications:
For the validation service, would you like to define qualitative descriptors (e.g., low, medium, high risk) or numeric scoring?
For the report service, do you envision a web interface where users can customize report sections, or will it be driven by configuration files?
Type Safety, Consistency, and Error Handling

Communication Protocols:

Transition to Python: No use of TypeScript interfaces, proxies, or enforced access controls. Clarification: Even though centralized error handling is not planned, would you prefer that each microservice logs errors in a standardized way (using a common logging library or format) even if it is not centralized?
Service Discovery:

Dynamic Info: No requirement for dynamic scaling information in the service registry. Clarification: Should the prompt include a basic service registry for listing available services, or rely solely on static configuration?
Configuration and Deployment Templates

Docker & Environment Configurations:

Security Best Practices: The Docker configurations will not enforce non-root execution or other advanced security practices.
Secrets Management: Managed through environment variables. Clarification: Although advanced secrets management isn’t required, would you like to include a note to ensure environment variables are not hard-coded in production images?
CI/CD Pipeline:

Testing & Deployment: No automated testing integration (unit, integration, or security scanning) or advanced deployment strategies (like canary or blue-green deployments) are planned. Clarification: While automation isn’t in scope, is there any expectation for manual testing guidelines or version control practices that should be documented?
Final Suggestions

Framework & Libraries: Since you are moving to Python, specifying the preferred frameworks (such as Flask, FastAPI, etc.) and any library preferences for scanning or AI would help ensure consistency and facilitate future enhancements.
Manual Intervention in AI Fallback: Clearly document the manual steps required when switching from Ollama to OpenAI. This might include user notifications, decision thresholds, or a simple interface for intervention.
Modular Report Generation: Elaborate on how users will "pick and choose" parts of the report. This could be implemented as a set of configuration options or through a dynamic user interface in the client application.
Versioning Strategy: Provide a more concrete description of the API versioning method to be used, which is critical for maintaining backward compatibility.
By addressing these clarifications, your CRAFT prompt will be more comprehensive and actionable. Let me know if you’d like to explore any of these points further or need additional suggestions.
